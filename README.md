# Excel to XML Localization Script

## Purpose
This script converts data from an Excel file into an XML format suitable for localization. It's tailored for handling multiple locales, aiding in internationalization efforts.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **`openpyxl` library** for handling Excel files
- Standard libraries: **`xml.etree.ElementTree`**, **`xml.dom`**

## Setup Instructions

2. Install `openpyxl` using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install openpyxl

## Usage
1. Prepare an Excel file named data.xlsx with data formatted for localization. Place it in the same directory as the script or update the excel_file_path variable in the script.
2. Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python ms-ach.py
3. The script reads the Excel data and converts it into XML format.

## Output Description
- The script generates an XML file formatted for localization.
- The current version of the script might not specify the output file path or name. This might need to be configured or the output may be directed to the console.

## Additional Notes
